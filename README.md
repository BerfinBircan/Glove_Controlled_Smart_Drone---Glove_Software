# Glove_Controlled_Smart_Drone---Glove_Software
This repository contains our Senior Design Project, where we developed a smart drone controlled by a glove. Designed with first responders in mind, this system allows them to operate the drone with one hand, keeping the other hand free for critical tasks in emergency situations.
